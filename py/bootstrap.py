# What the site installs, in groups: "bilby" at startup, "lalsuite" for the
# first GW example, and one group per extra. Each group lists packages from
# the Pyodide distribution (loadPackage) and from PyPI (micropip).
#
# These specs are only *resolved* by scripts/lock-packages.mjs, which records
# the exact PyPI wheels each group needs in packages.lock.json. The site and
# the Node runner install from that lock: the wheels are served by the site
# (wheels/pypi/, downloaded by scripts/fetch-pypi-wheels.py), installed
# without dependency resolution, so page loads are reproducible and do not
# depend on PyPI. The local wheels (bilby, LALSuite, igwn-segments; see
# wheels/index.json) are installed separately.
#
# The "bilby" group is locked once for each bilby version in
# bilby-versions.json, whose "pins" replace the specs here of the same
# packages (an older bilby may need an older dynesty); the other groups are
# the same for every version.
#
# bilby-cython is optional for bilby but makes the GW time and geometry
# functions faster. nestle-bilby provides the nestle sampler through the
# bilby.samplers entry point; it is installed without dependencies because
# micropip may not accept our development build of bilby as satisfying its
# bilby>=x.y requirement.
